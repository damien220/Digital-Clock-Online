# Dynamic Digital Clock

 A modern and futuristic dynamic digital clock built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project displays the current time with an animated digit change effect, offering a sleek and engaging user experience.

## ✨ Features

  * **Real-time Display:** Shows the current hour, minute, and second, updating every second.
  * **Futuristic Design:** Utilizes a dark background, vibrant green digits, and the `Orbitron` font for a sci-fi aesthetic.
  * **Animated Digit Change:** Smooth transition effect when digits change, enhancing the futuristic feel.
  * **Responsive:** Designed to look good on various screen sizes (though primarily optimized for larger displays for the large font).
  * **Pure Frontend:** Built solely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – no backend dependencies.
